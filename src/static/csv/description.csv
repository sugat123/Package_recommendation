Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) trek is very popular trekking route among the trekkers. The mountain scenery going to Annapurna Base Camp is great as well but one issue is that you spend most of your time trekking up the canyon of the Modi Khola which is fairly deep and obscures direct line of sight with the peaks. 

You start to get out of the canyon after you reach the small village of Doban but this is already close to Annapurna Base Camp. One of the peaks you will see before reaching Doban is Machapuchre or Fish Tail, which is an amazing peak and often called the Matterhorn of the Himalayas. Once you start to make your way into the Annapurna Sanctuary the views are of course great and at Base Camp you are standing directly in front of Annapurna and surrounded by peaks on all sides.

The Annapurna Base Camp trek is the obvious holy grail of this trek. At 4,130 m, trekkers are surrounded on all sides by spectacular snow-capped peaks, like the supreme Annapurna I (8,091m) and its sisters Annapurna South, Annapurna Fang, Annapurna III. You will also have good views of Hiunchuli, Gangapurna, Khangsar Kang, Tent Peak and the iconic Machapuchare, also known as Fishtail Mountain.

Our short Annapurna base camp trek starts from from Nayapul, a short distance from Pokhara. The pastoral landscape becomes visible after you cross the bridge across the Modi Khola, a raging river that originates in the East Annapurna glacier and serves as a navigational beacon till the end of the journey.

The switchback trail from Ghandruk to Chomrong, the next village, is a long walk along the mountain before it dips into the forest and continues up the other side of the valley. Woodpeckers, babblers and minivets are visible, and you hear the calls of a plenitude of birds. The path is easy to navigate and the red and white signs painted on the dressed stones, an initiative by a couple of individuals in tandem with the Annapurna Conservation Area Project. 

The walk from Chomrong, down the wonderful cobblestoned stairs, past the suspension bridge across the Chomrong khola with Annapurna South to the left and the river roaring down to the right, is filled with glittering possibilities of what could lie ahead. 

The trek then goes further up to the crest of the mountain before plunging into a forest of about-to-flower rhododendron trees, oak and bamboo. From now on, trekking groups become much fewer and mule packs disappear.	 #####

Starting from less than 1,000 meters, it gives us a chance to explore the Himalayas from bottom to top and from many different angles and perspectives.

This magnificent trek leads you to the fine village, inhabited by a wide diversity of people from different ethnic groups, offering spectacular and majestic views of the Himalayas. Continuing to the north of the main Himalayan range to the high and dry Tibetan Plateau, the scenery is equally breathtaking.

The highest point of the Annapurna Circuit is the Thorong La Pass at the top of the valley at 5,416 m. Due to the difficulties of crossing the pass, the circuit is usually walked in a counter-clockwise direction. Traveling clockwise the longer ascent and shorter descent from west to east is too much for many people to manage in one day.

As we descend to the west at Muktinath, from the pass we continue to the barren Tibetan like village of the Kali Gandaki – the world’s deepest gorge, passes between the giant Annapurna and Dhaulagiri mountains. After you cross the Thorong La Pass from Manang to Muktinath, we head to Tatopani hotsprings and climb to Poon Hill before descending to Pokhara.	 #####

Upper Mustang trekking is getting more popular day by day because of the Annapurna Circuit trek losing some popularity caused by rampant road construction. 

The Upper Mustang trek is the most culturally rich trekking region in Nepal and for travellers who would like to trek in a very remote area, and explore pristine Buddhist culture, which has remained more or less the same throughout the centuries. 

The region houses several monasteries that are over a thousand years old, and also hundreds of ancient caves. The terrain is mostly Himalayan mountain desert, where local families get by with growing whatever they possibly can to feed themselves. Ancient Tibetan civilisation is the main attraction of the Mustang area. The Upper Mustang region is situated on the western Himalayan range, close to the Tibetan border. The high desert region of the Tibetan plateau between the Tibetan border to Kagbeni is usually referred to as "Upper Mustang". 

Our Upper Mustang trek begins from Pokhara valley in the western part of Nepal. You will fly from Pokhara to Jomsom, which takes about 25 minutes. After we arrive in Jomsom, we start our upper Mustang trek through the holy bank of the Kaligandaki river and follow it upstream to get to Lo-Manthang, the capital of upper Mustang. On the Upper Mustang trek, you will get a chance to visit thousand-year-old monasteries, ancient caves, local tribes and an amazing landscape. From upper Mustang you can see panoramic views of the majestic himalayan mountains Nilgiri, Annapurna, Dhaulagiri and a number of other peaks, adding a natural delight to your cultural feast.

The Home Ministry of Nepal opened the restricted Upper Mustang area for trekking in October only in 1991. However, Upper Mustang is still strictly managed, and you need to obtain a special permit from the department of immigration, which is meant to protect their tradition from outside influence as well as to protect the environment. We will be staying in guesthouses for the night all along the way. 

Note: This trek requires some effort. If you can manage up to 6 hours of walking per day, you can easily do this trek.  #####

Our trek passes through several charming villages, frozen waterfalls, dense forests and agricultural farmlands with spectacular scenery until we reach Mera Peak Base Camp. 

At the Base Camp, we will spend some time for acclimatization and prepare for the Mera Peak climb. Once we are fully acclimatized and properly equipped with all the necessary climbing gears, we will follow an experienced climbing expert and tackle technical sections of the peak as we head towards the summit. Our tiring climb to the summit is rewarded with sensational views of Everest, Nuptse, Lhotse, Cho Oyu, Makalu, Amadablam and many other peaks within Everest region. 

We will spend a short amount of time at the summit and descend down following the same route. For our return journey, we will retrace our steps back to reach Lukla. Our memorable journey ends with a scenic flight from Lukla back to Kathmandu.

The trek around Manaslu-Tsum Valley was officially opened to tourists in 1991. This region of Nepal sees few trekkers, which makes a visit here more exclusive and well-preserved. The Manaslu Tsum Valley trekking region offers pristine nature and great trekking trails and is therefore an ideal trekking destination in Nepal if you have 25 days available. We kindly refer to the itinerary tab for a day-to-day itinerary for this trek.

The trek will start in Kathmandu early morning at 06:30 am where we will take a 6 hours bus drive to Arughat where the trekking will start. Arughat lies at an altitude of 700 meters. 

The highest and hardest day of the trek is the day of crossing the Larke pass at 5100 meters. The fact that the trek has such a high variation in altitude also means that you will be passing through a great deal of varying landscapes and climatic zones. 

The ‘Abominable Snowman‘ or ‘Yeti’ has reportedly been seen in this remote land, the Tsum Valley is also home to a pilgrimage route as it is believed that the great Buddhist Guru Milarepa once meditated in a mountain cave of this valley. On this trek you will also get to see the natural hot springs in Tatopani. It is believed that the hot water of this spring cure any kind of skin infection. 

During this trek you will get spectacular views of Ganesh Himal and Mt. Manaslu, the world's 8th highest mountain. The word 'Tsum' stems from the Tibetan word 'Tsombo', which means vivid. The remote and vivid Tsum Valley is an attraction in itself. In comparison to all trips to Nepal this is the absolute highlight, with strong, friendly, hospitable people, a living Buddhist culture and untouched wildlife because of Buddhist prohibitions on hunting.

Tsum Valley is a very sacred place for Buddhists, and Tsum valley holds important old monasteries. For centuries, people here have been dependent on subsistence agriculture, grazing herds of yak, and small trade too. 

As an added feature to this trek you will be visiting Buddhist Lama who will teach us about the basics of Buddhism and help coordinate a special blessing ceremony at one of the area monasteries. Buddhist Lama is also willing to lead optional brief meditation sessions for interested clients. The altitude of Tsum Valley Trekking varies from 1905m in Lhokpa to over 5093m at Ngula Dhojhyang pass on the Tibetan border.

The Manaslu -Tsum trek is a restricted trekking area and can only be done by 2 people or more.

Trekkers mistakenly overlook the valleys of Langtang and Helambu for the Annapurna and Everest regions. Although only a day’s drive from Kathmandu this region is a relatively isolated wilderness with sacred lakes and great snowcapped peaks. Langtang is situated north of Kathmandu Valley, bordering Tibet, whilst Helambu Valley lies north east of the valley, bordering Langtang. Both of these areas are predominately inhabited by Tibetans and Tamangs who share a similar religion, language and attire. 
The trek traverses from the west to the east crossing extremely diverse landscapes: rice-terraces, gigantic rhododendron and fir forests in the lowlands, and in the highest parts you will find a rock and shrub wilderness with incredible backdrops of snowy peaks, and an arena of glaciers below Langtang Lirung (7,225m).

The big mountain scenery of Manaslu and Ganesh is astonishing. There’s the two-horned massif of Manaslu (8156m), the circumnavigation of which is a meditation on the wonders of Himalayan geology. There’s Ganesh Himal (7406m), named for the serpentine southern ridge that evokes the elephant-headed Hindu god of good fortune. And then there’s Himalchuli (7893m), which rises an incredible 7000m from the Marsyangdi River. Nestled in between these Himalayan giants are villages that draw from Hindu and Buddhist influences. Add a sprinkling of butterflies amidst forests from sal to pine, and you’ll be convinced you’ll catch a sight of the shy red panda.

This is probably one of the world's most awe-inspiring treks, and since 1977 has been one of Nepal’s classics. A complete circuit of the Annapurna range. Our route takes you through a fascinating variety of landscapes and cultures, from the sub-tropical lower Marsyangdi Valley where Hindu (Gurung and Thakali) settlements dominate to the predominately Buddhist areas of the northern arid semi-desert Tibetan Plateau. The contrast could not be more dramatic or diverse.

Along the Marsyangdi Khola, on easy trails and suspension bridges, through rice terraces and forests, you will slowly gain altitude and acclimatize in preparation for the ascend towards the arid semi-desert with stunning and extremely up-close views of snowy and glaciated high peaks including Annapurnas II, III and IV. This remote area lies in a rain shadow formed by the Annapurnas and the landscape supports little in the way of forests apart from pine, juniper and scrub rhododendron. Thus, it is huge glacial moraines abound, etched deeply by wind erosion into fantastic pillars. The crossing of the Thorung La Pass at 5,416m is one of the highlights of this trek, where we are rewarded with breathtaking scenery.	 #####

Until recently the Upper Mustang was one of the most isolated and unexplored corners of the Trans-Himalayan region. Foreign trekkers were first allowed to visit in 1992. Since its opening this region has become a very special destination for trekkers, despite the expensive permit fees compared to other regions. Once Upper Mustang used to be a separate kingdom and still it looks like a kingdom of a different kind, not only because of its topographic uniqueness but also because of its untouched Tibetan culture, people and their traditions. New lodges have made this trek more comfortable these days.

A few places in the world can offer magical and majestic mountain vistas and incredible trekking,and Nepal is one of them.

The Api Himal Exploratory tour starts and ends in Kathmandu. The Api Himal Exploratory is a Trekking tour that takes 32 days taking you through Kathmandu, Nepal and other destinations in Nepal. An exploratory trek to the remote Api-Saipal region of western Nepal. Looked at from the plains of India, the Nepal Himalaya form an almost unbroken stretch of white snowy peaks for five hundred kilometres from Kanchenjunga in the far east to Kanjiroba, just west of Dhaulagiri. But then for nearly two hundred kilometres there is a distinct lack of high, shining white mountains. Only on the north-western border of Nepal do the mountains rise up again to soar beyond 7000 metres. This is the seldom visited Api-Saipal massif a remote region that has remained little changed while places such as the Annapurnas and Khumbu boast espresso serving internet lounges!
For those who have been everywhere else to those who just prefer to get well off the beaten path, this trek promises to offer one of the treks of a lifetime. Sub-tropical valleys, flowering rhododendron covered hillsides, alpine ridge traverses, high valleys below the 7000m peaks of Api and Saipal, glaciated passes and cultures ranging from the Hindu aligned tribes of the foothills to Tibetan aligned Bhotias in the north, this trek offers all the diversity of the classical Himalayan trek - all over ground that has seldom or never seen a foreigner. 
The only pre-requisite for this trek is that you be reasonably fit and have a love for getting off the beaten track. Typically, as with most exploratory treks we will be following local paths everywhere up to the alpine zone where plants stop growing in profusion - from any such place upwards, the route will be on scree, moraine, snow and rock. There is no scheduled climbing although you are encouraged to bring/hire basic climbing gear such as crampons (and boots to take them), harness and ice axe for possible snowy pass crossings or should any easy smaller peak reveal itself. There may or may not be steep terrain to negotiate on a pass - if there is, rope will be fixed and the pass negotiated in an orderly and safe manner. Indeed we may be turned back at several points by an impasse but we will simply find another way around - there is always another way around, the trick is to find the most interesting one possible!
We are unsure of the maximum altitude of the trek but it’s very unlikely to be more than 5500m with a possible optional day excursion to a higher point. The nature of the landscape in far western Nepal is not radically different to many other parts of the Himalaya. Like just over the border in Kumaon (Nanda Devi region) and in far eastern Nepal, the foothills are extensive and range southwards for a quite a distance from the crest of the main massifs meaning there are high ridges, forested to 4,400m and deep valleys. Roughly speaking for 22 days we will be walking in a north-easterly direction. 
We will fly to Dhangadi then take a bus to the Chamlia river near Gokuleshwor. Our trek then starts up the valley of the Chamlia river, a typical medium sized Himalayan glacial river in a sub-tropical setting. Days should be hot with plenty of swimming opportunities. After about four days we will have climbed up the valley to over 3000m, we will establish a base camp then take a foray up to the base of Api Himal. This will serve us well as acclimatisation for the next stage which will be our first pass attempt at 5400 metres that will take us over to the upper Seti valley, crossing an old trading route that leads to the Urai Lagna pass (written about in Spy On the Roof of the World by Sydney Wignall, recommended reading). Time permitting we will gain a high point on this ridge so that we can get good views of Mount Gurla Mandhata which is particularly holy to the Tibetans and Hindus. We will then make our way to the eastern branch of the upper Seti to walk under the north face of Saipal and then over a 5300m pass leading to the upper reaches of the Humla Karnali watershed which eventually leads us to the district administrative centre of Simikot, from where we fly back to Kathmandu.	 ##### 





We are pleased to be able to offer the amazing Langtang Valley Trek to the high alpine region that surrounds the incredible, fertile Kathmandu Valley. Set aside as a national park, the Langtang Valley is the third most popular place to visit in Nepal because of its magnificent beauty.

A day tour of Kathmandu covers the important monuments of Kathmandu Valley within one day. After having breakfast in a hotel we visit the famous temples of Kathmandu like Swayambhunath Stupa (Monkey Temple), Pashupatinath Temple, Patan Durbar Square, and Bhaktapur Durbar Square, Kathmandu's largest and most impressive Durbar square. 

Below please find some brief insights about some of the monuments and squares that we will visit:

Pashupatinath Temple:
Pashupatinath temple is one of the holiest temple of Lord Shiva, according to the Hindu religion. Situated on side of lush green natural forest the temple is built in pagoda style with gilded roof and richly carved silver doors. The holy river Bagmati flows aside the Temple. Pashupatinath Temple is mostly visited on Mondays where the temple is crowded by its devotees. 

Swayambhunath Temple:
Syambhunath Temple can be seen from different parts of Kathmandu Valley as it lies on the top of a hill West of the City. Swayambhunath Temple is the most popular and instantly recognisable symbols of Nepal, a 2000 years old Buddhist shrine. We can also visit the Saraswati (goddess of Study) Temple which is near of Swayambhunath Temple. We can see many monkeys on our way to Swayambhunath Temple, hence its other name, Monkey Temple. 

Patan Durbar Square
Patan is a small city that touches Kathmandu and Bhaktapur. The mostly visited place of Patan is Patan Durbar square which constitutes numerous temples within a small area. The entire east side of the Durbar square is dominated by the ancient royal palace that were used to be ruled by the Malla Dynesty. Patan is also known as the city of fine arts which consists of remarkable monuments like Krishna Temple, Banglamukhi Temple, Patan Museum and many others.

Kathmandu Durbar Square:
Kathmandu Durbar Square is the natural place to begin our sightseeing. The old royal palace, running along the eastern edge of the square, takes up more space than all the other monuments here combined. Kumari Chock, home of Katmandu's "Living goddess", overlooks the square from the south. The square itself is squeezed by the palace into two parts: the Southern part with Kasthamandap, the ancient building that probably gave Kathmandu its name, and the Northern part, taken up by various processions of statues and temples. The building here is the greatest achievement of the Malla dynasty, resulting from the great rivalry between the three palaces of Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur. 

Kathmandu Valley was once divided among the children of Yaksya Malla. For visitors today, and for the Nepalese, it was serendipitous that they, and later their off springs, began an artistic warfare trying to outdo each other in splendid contributions. Kings copied everything their neighbors built in an even grander style. Today, all three Durbar squares are visited by thousands of people daily. Unfortunately the recent earthquake in Nepal destroyed some of the temples, but the squares are still worth visiting. 

We look forward to giving you a wonderful day of sightseeing in Kathmandu.

All rafting will take place in SunKoshi (the river of gold), one of Nepal's best rivers for river rafting. Day 1 and Day 10 will be spent on transport to/from Kathmandu, and the other 8 days will be spent river rafting, enjoying nature, playing games, camping at night - or in short, having a blast!

The starting point of the 270 kilometers long river adventure is Dolalghat or Roshi Khola (Nepalthok), which is a 3-hour drive from Kathmandu valley, and the take out point, or end point at Day 10, is Chatara, which is a 16-hour drive from Kathmandu.

From straightforward waves to powerful and intense ones, the rapid of the river changes from class 3 to class 4 as you move further down the river. We will therefore start with easy rapids and slowly get you on top of how to handle bigger rapids. 

The best seasons to gain a thrilling and a safe experience of rafting in Sunkoshi is from September to November and May to June. However, please note that Sunkoshi doesn’t just give you a thrilling rafting experience but also gives you a chance to witness Nepal's fascinating nature close up.

Nagurjun Hike is a day program with a hike to the nearby Nagarjun hill located 23 km north-west of Kathmandu city. Nagarjun hill is at 6300 feet above the sea-level and this program is one of the popular day hikes around Kathmandu Valley. 

The hike is through Shivapuri National Park which has abundant flora and faunas. Upon reaching the top, the summit provides majestic panorama view of the entire Kathmandu Valley including the snow-capped mountains like Langtang Lirung, Dorje Lakpa, Ganesh Himal and other majestic Himalayan peaks. 

Any age groups can participate in this and it gives a nice approach to what it’s like to be hiking in the Himalayan region, albeit much closer to Kathmandu City, compared with e.g. a trek to Annapurna Circuit.

Kathmandu Valley holds unique geographical, cultural and natural sights for visitors, which we will help you explore. Discover the three major areas within the valley and see the most important sights. 

We will start our tour by visiting the UNESCO World Heritage Sites speckled in the region of the valley. We visit Swoyambhunath, which is said to be over 2,000 years old and one of the world's most fabulous Buddhists Stupas; located on the top of a hill west of the Kathmandu city which is identified as the 'Monkey Temple'. From its peak, Swayambhunath presents excellent views of Kathmandu valley.

Canyoning, the sport of abseiling (repelling) down waterfalls, is an adventure sport that gets you off the beaten track in Nepal and cannot be missed by adrenaline seekers and water sports enthusiasts. Journey through narrow passages of rock which have been contoured by ages of rushing water from the Himalayan snow melts and heavy monsoon rains. Travel down canyons using a variety of techniques including walking, scrambling, climbing, cliff jumping, abseiling and swimming. Now doesn't that sound like fun?!

Jalberi Canyon is the best canyoning spot in Nepal! Our canyoning site is in a small village called Jalberi, offering great day trips from Kathmandu, Chitwan or Pokhara or a great addition to your rafting or kayaking trip on the Trisuli. You do not need any previous experience to join as we can teach you everything you need to know and have all the equipment and expertise to keep you safe and show you a great time with incredible scenery to boot. You will just need a good attitude and sense of adventure!

Trips depart from Kathmandu at 6.30am nearly all year round (arrangements can be made from Pokhara or Chitwan on request and we take a short break during the monsoon months when the water is too high). Once we arrive, we will change at a small house at the bottom of the hill. There will be time for a quick cup of tea before a 20-minute hike to the top where you will be greeted with a 100meter waterfall. While your guides prepare the equipment, you'll have time for a photo opportunity under the epic waterfall or a quick dip in one of the natural pools. You will then be given a harness, life jacket, and helmet and after a comprehensive safety briefing, we'll teach you how to climb and abseil and then we are ready to go...! The trip starts with a jump into the canyon, it will get your heart beating right from the very beginning!

The largest waterfall we run is around 26 meters. Sometimes we slide and sometimes we jump directly into the clear pools below. After around 3 1/2 hours of adrenaline fueled fun we'll stop for a picnic lunch in the canyon before the drive back to Kathmandu, Chitwan or Pokhara.	 #####

This Everest Base Camp Helicopter tour gives you a quick look into the famous Everest region, landing at Everest Base Camp (or Kalapathar).

A highlight of our trek is a visit to Kyanjin Gompa (3800m), a Buddhist monastery in a spectacular sub-alpine setting. From Kyanjin we traverse several passes that afford impressive views enroute to the sacred lakes of Gosainkund.

Want to know what it was like to live in medieval times? Then hitch a ride on this Kathmandu tour that reveals two, ancient satellite cities often overlooked by travellers. With shrines and temples aplenty, just follow the smell of incense to these old-world towns. 

There are some who say travel is about going places and doing things. When it comes to Patan and Bhaktapur, it’s simply about ‘being there’.

It’s easy to just explore Kathmandu, but we want to encourage you to discover the Kathmandu Valley’s two other former kingdoms – Patan and Bhaktapur. Between the buzzing markets, the artistry of the age-old temples and palaces, and the medieval feel of both cities, you’ll be sure to leave Nepal with a much deeper understanding of this incredible place.

We’ll take you on a tour from Kathmandu into another world, first to Patan, about a half an hour’s drive away. As you enter the ancient city, you’ll be taken aback by the vivid contrast to Kathmandu. Although these days Patan is part of the sprawl of the Kathmandu conurbation, Patan has an identify of its own, including the Centre of Sanskrit Learning (hence why you may see and hear of Patan by its Sanskrit name, Lalitpur, meaning City of Living Art).

The influences in Patan have transcended centuries, perhaps culminating in the 12th to 16th Century era of the Mallas and their extraordinarily creative Newar civilization. Surrounding the city’s main square are noble royal and religious structures, which highlight the Hindu pantheon, mainly of Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva. Additionally, you’ll have the opportunity to explore Patan’s excellent museum that features some superb artifacts from both Buddhist and Hindu traditions, leaving you well informed of the glories of the past and the span of civilizations that have flourished and competed here in the Himalayas.

Leaving Patan behind, we’ll head for the medieval city of Bhaktapur, which will take us about 45 minutes. As if held in a time warp, the little city of Bhaktapur amazes everyone. Upon entering this ‘City of Devotees’, you’ll quickly realise that you have entered a time of feudal ways and medieval street-scenes, with a uniquely magical ambiance that confidently eschews modernity for tradition.

Bhaktapur is also a place where your eyes naturally want to shift skyward towards the pagoda rooftops, but don’t forget to come back down to earth to peer down bustling ancient alleyways. Challenge yourself to keep still and absorb the activity around you. As we like to say - all one’s five senses are employed, and then add to that a sixth sense – one of idle exploration!

The definitive building in Bhaktapur is the 30m high Nyatapola Temple, with its five pagoda roof lines towering above the market square. That being said, Nyatapola Temple is centre point and iconic landmark amidst thousands of palaces, temples, and shrines, constantly employed - enticing or warding off deities and demons with offerings (typically floral and food or percussion or horn music). As such, it’s well known that in Bhaktapur, there’s an ever present incessant clanging and tinkling of big and little bells. You get used to it – it’s all part of the Bhaktapur charm.

Senses enriched and fascinated, we’ll head back to Kathmandu, which will take us about an hour. You’ll be glad you got out of the capital and explored the Kathmandu Valley with us.	 #####

From the bazaar town of Chautara we gradually ascend a long ridge, the Kami Danda, with fabulous views east and west of a chain of mountains that form a natural border with Tibet. W.H. Tilman was the first European to explore this region in 1949, and very few have ever retraced his footsteps.

Upper Mustang Trekking offers a great opportunity to get insights into Trans Himalayan region of Annapurna which is quite similar to Tibetan trans-Himalayan topography. The colorful rock formations with numerous cave dwellings high up the cliffs, impressive chortens and ancient monasteries reflect the culture and traditions of Buddhism. Along with topographical similarities, the local people still follow the centuries old life style and traditions. You get an amazing feeling of isolation while trekking around the deserted lands which also enchants and inspires visitors to this region. 

Major attraction and actually an opportunity during our Upper Mustang trek is the walled city of Lo-Manthang palaces. Upper Mustang is known as forbidden kingdom and still sees very few tourists each year. Trek along the land of canyons of the Kali Gandaki River, across the rugged land where people have saved their centuries old culture in Buddhist chortens, small stupas, atop hills, on pathways leading into villages and even inside caves. Tibetan Buddhism and the myths are intertwined threads that are in turn woven into the landscape. 

Finally as you reach Lo Manthang, we will also arrange your meeting to King of Mustang, Jigme Parbal Bista in the walled capital Lo Manthang. Yes, Nepal is republic but Mustang even today has a king! The Mustangi locals have their own head of the tribe whom they respect, he is known as Mustangi King. Visit the three red-walled monasteries at the heart of the town; watch the astonishing way of life and family life around the nomadic villages.

The best time to trek around Upper Mustang Trek is from the month of March to November. This trek can be joined even during the monsoon season as Upper Mustang lies in rain-shadow area and receives negligible amount of rainfall. So, except in winter due to extreme cold, this trek to the hidden kingdom is recommended during anytime of the year.

This is remote trekking at its best!. Trekking in far-west Nepal is like stepping back in time to when the first Europeans began exploring the Himalaya. Locals will greet you with genuine curiosity and you'll enjoy the interations in this region that very few westerners make the effort to visit. The region has an ancient political history as a seat of the first Malla Empire, and stele and other architectural remains are tucked away in almost every valley. The trail from Dolpo is still a regular trading route for Nepalese and Tibetans and leads straight to the largest lake in Nepal, Rara. From here we cross the Great Himalaya Range following the Karnali river and crossing stunning passes to Humla, the largest and most remote district of Nepal, and finally to the Tibet border and the western end of the Great Himalaya Trail. For those who are completing the full GHT, this trek marks the end of a remarkable and very rare journey across the entire length of the Nepal GHT. 
During this trek there will be sections where the trail is very rugged or ill-defined. Space in some camp sites will also be very limited. It may be necessary to make changes to the itinerary at any time due to unforeseen circumstances such as adverse weather, snow or trail conditions, river water levels, or group movement. Your trip leader will advise any changes should this occur. All participants on the GHT should be flexible and open minded. The GHT should be seen as exploratory in the true sense of the word.
The Australian Himalayan Foundation is dedicated to helping the people of the Himalaya achieve their goals through supporting and overseeing education, health, cultural and environmental projects. With a $100 donation for every booking on the GHT World Expeditions will help support sustainable tourism development in regions less frequented by trekkers.

The Manaslu trek is one of Nepal's best treks. If you have 17 days available for trekking in Nepal, we highly recommend this trek. It is challenging, especially the day of crossing the Larke pass at 5,135 m but if you are in reasonable shape, determined, and able to walk 6 hours a day, you can do this trek. 

Manaslu is the eighth highest peak in the world, bordering the Gorkha and Manang districts in Nepal. It is just 64km East of the previously popular Annapurna treks. Literally, Manaslu is derived from Sanskrit with manasa means “Mountain of the spirit". The Manaslu region encompasses everything from sub tropical foothills to the arid Trans-Himalaya high pastures bordering Tibet.

The Manaslu trek opened only in 1991. Its popularity increased significantly when teahouses become available around 2009. The Manaslu region has no roads or alike and the trekking trails are excellent. This combined with a high variation in altitude starting from around 700 m and getting up to 5,135 m is the reason why the Manaslu trek today is preferred over the Annapurna trek. 

After a 6 hours bus ride from Kathmandu, the trek begins Arughat. En-route the trek, you will not only see spectacular mountain scenery but can also visit several monasteries.

If you have 19 days available, you will not regret choosing this trek. If you are in doubt as to physical fitness we highly recommend adding a porter. 1 porter can carry up to 30 kgs and can thus be shared between 2 people. 

We are looking forward to taking you on a fantastic trekking adventure.  #####
